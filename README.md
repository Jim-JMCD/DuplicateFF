# DuplicateFF
A small Linux app that compares files using sha256. Input can be one or more directories with optional filters of maximum files size and parts of file names (e.g. ‘.mp4’ ‘IMG’ ) . Output is multiple CSV (spreadsheet) reports that can be used to move or delete duplicates. Can be used on Linux, Windows (WSL2, MSYS2 and Gitbash).
